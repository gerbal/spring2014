## Chunxi's CodingBat

**Choose three exercise.**

**1.List1-make pi**

 I feel this one is very interesting is because the code is quiet simple. I thought the problem would be harder. 
 So I tried to define pi as the first step. In fact, you do not need to do that. Finally, I simply type
 
 ```
 return [3,1,4]
 ```
 
 **2.Logic-1 > date_fashion**
 
 I made a mistake at first. The logic here is interesting. 
 The original version is:
 
  ```
 def date_fashion(you, date):
  if you>=8 or date>=8:
   return 2
  if you<=2 or date<=2:
   return 0
  else:
   return 1
  ```
   
   But is had problems. If you is greater than 8, your date is less than 2. It will return 2. What I expect is 0. Therefore, I changed the order.
  
  ```
  def date_fashion(you, date):
  if you<=2 or date<=2:
   return 0
  if you>=8 or date>=8:
   return 2
  
  else:
   return 1
  ```
  
  **3.Logic-1 > caught_speeding**
 
  At the very beginning, I tried to devide into two parts. If it is my birthday or not. Then consider the speed. But I found out there were a lot to input. Most of them were same.Therefore, I tried to simpify the code. To make the code shorter. I define "boon", if it is not the birthday, it will be 0.
 
 ```
def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
 boon = 0
 if is_birthday == True:
   boon = 5
 if speed <= 60+boon:
   return 0
 elif speed >= 81+boon:
   return 2
 else:
   return 1
 ```
